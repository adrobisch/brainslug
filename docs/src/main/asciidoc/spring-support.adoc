## Spring Support

It is possible integrate brainslug with the Spring application context, so that the Spring Beans
are available in the execution context.

### Setup

Just import the spring configuration class into you application context.

Calls to the `ExecutionContext` or the `Registry` will then return the beans from the Spring application context:

[source, java]
----
include::{exampleBase}/brainslug/example/spring/ConfigurationExample.java[tags=spring-example]
----

Will output the two lines:

[source, bash]
----
Hello World!
Hello again!
----
