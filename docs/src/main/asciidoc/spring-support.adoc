## Spring Support

It is possible integrate brainslug with the Spring application context, so that the Spring Beans
are available in the execution context.
To use it, you need to get the http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22brainslug-spring%22[`brainslug-spring` module].

### Setup

Just import the spring configuration class into you application context.

Calls to the `ExecutionContext` or the `Registry` will then return the beans from the Spring application context.

All beans of type `FlowBuilder` will be made available in the `BrainslugContext` as well:

[source, java]
----
include::{exampleBase}/spring/ConfigurationExample.java[tags=spring-example]
----

Will output the two lines:

[source, bash]
----
Hello World!
Hello again!
----

### Custom BrainslugContext

To configure the `BrainslugContext` in your `ApplicationContext` you can use the `SpringBrainslugContextBuilder`:

[source, java]
----
include::{exampleBase}/spring/ContextBuilderExample.java[tags=builder-example]
----
