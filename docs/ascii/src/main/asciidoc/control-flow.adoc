# Control Flow

## Brainslug Flow Node Types

### Task Node

A Task Node will be executed for every incoming token and produces one token per outgoing edge. See the [task documentation](task)
for details on how to define what a task should do during execution.

### Event Node

An Event Node is triggered by every incoming token and produces one token per outgoing edge.
There are different type of event: Start Events, End Events, Wait (Intermediate) Events.

Start Events mark the start of a flow and are generally the starting point of your flow definition.
The `waitFor`-method takes an event definition which might have duration to wait for and create a intermediate event
for it.

End Events mark the end of a flow execution path and are optional.

### Choice Node

A Choice Node will be executed for every incoming token. A token is produced for the first outgoing path
where the predicate is fullfilled.

### Merge Node

A Merge Node merges different execution paths. It will be executed for every incoming token. A token is produced for every outgoing edge.

## Example with Choice and Merge Nodes

### Parallel Node

A Parallel Node defines flow paths which are meant for parallel execution, if the execution is really concurrent depends on the
configuration of the corresponding `FlowNodeExecutor`. It will be executed for every incoming token. A token is produced for every outgoing edge.

### Join Node

A Parallel Node joins or synchronizes multiple concurrent execution paths. It will only be executed if it has tokens from every incoming edge.
A token is produced for every outgoing edge.
