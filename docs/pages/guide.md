# Execution

## Flow Definition

A flow definition is a directed graph of typed flow nodes. brainslug provides a set of predefined node types
which are interpreted by the execution module. Generally its up to the user to define the meaning of the graph,
but its common to see it as the definition of possible paths / sequence of actions for a desired outcome, e.g.
the steps to prepare a sandwich, or a ordering process.

See the [FlowBuilderTest](https://github.com/adrobisch/brainslug/blob/master/model/src/test/java/brainslug/flow/builder/FlowBuilderTest.java) class
for examples on how to build flow definitions.

## Flow Instance

A flow instance is a single execution of a given flow definition. Depending on the brainslug configuration and flow definition
an instance might be a persistent and long running, or just be executed in-memory.

## Flow Token

A flow token is a pointer to a flow node in a flow instance. A flow node might have multiple tokens.
The token includes the information it came from. A flow node needs the correct amount of tokens to be ready
for execution and will produce a defined amount of new flow node after execution.

# Node Types

## Task Node

A Task Node will be executed for every incoming token and produces one token per outgoing edge.

## Event Node

An Event Node is triggered by every incoming token and produces one token per outgoing edge.

## Choice Node

A Choice Node will be executed for every incoming token. A token is produced for the first outgoing path
where the predicate is fullfilled.

## Merge Node

A Merge Node will be executed for every incoming token. A token is produced for every outgoing edge.

## Parallel Node

A Parallel Node will be executed for every incoming token. A token is produced for every outgoing edge.

## Join Node

A Parallel Node will only be executed if it has tokens from every incoming edge.
A token is produced for every outgoing edge.

# Integration with your code

In order to connect you code with a brainslug flow definition you may use method call definition:

```java
    new FlowBuilder() {
      @Override
      public void define() {
        start(event(id(START)))
        .execute(task(id(TASK))
          .call(service(TestService.class).method("getString")))
        .end(event(id(END)));
      }
    }
```

or a delegate class:

```java
    class Delegate {
      @Execute
      public void execute(ExecutionContext context) {
      ...
      }
    }
    ...
    context.getRegistry().registerService(Delegate.class, new Delegate());
    ...
    new FlowBuilder() {
      @Override
      public void define() {
        start(event(id(START)))
          .execute(task(id(TASK)).delegate(Delegate.class)))
        .end(event(id(END)));
      }
    }
```
